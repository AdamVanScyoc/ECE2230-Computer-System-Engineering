Linked List Program

Construct an inventory for the hack game that stores game objects in a
double-linked list.

The following header files are provided:

list.h
hack_object.h
hack_inventory.h

Your assignment is to implement all of the functions in these header
files in the corresponding .c file (list.c, hack_object.c, and
hack_inventory.c). Refer to documentation above each function
declaration.

It must be possible to create multiple independent instances of list
and h_inventory. In a practical sense this means no static or global
variables should be defined in list.c or hack_inventory.c.

The user interface of the main program (assign2.c) should be extended
to include the following commands:

ADD, DEL, LOOK, LIST (as before), FIRST, LAST, NEXT, PREV
